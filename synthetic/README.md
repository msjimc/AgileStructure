# Synthetic test data

While structural rearrangements are generally classed as **translocations**, **duplications**, **insertions**, **inversions** and **deletions**, many are more complex with for example sequence lost at the insertion site creating an **insertion - deletion**. This results in a very large number of possible types of rearrangements and it would be very hard to collect a patient cohort that covers them all. Consequently, to test AgileStructure, a number of synthetic long read data sets derived from modified chromosomes (human chr 7 and 8) were  made. Since these where artificial datasets, the exact rearrangement is known making the checking the results straight forward. 

Since the range of synthetic data was primarily intended to check the annotation functions, some datasets are very similar and designed to test how rearrangements in different numeric and alphabetical orders were processed (i.e. insert from chr8 to chr7 compared to an insertion from chr7 to chr8). However, they have all been included here to show what different rearrangements look like in the interface and suggest how to select the relevant split reads.    

Since the naming convention can result in arbitrary decisions being made when annotating a variant, for instance it is not clear how close an inserted sequence can be to the original site before is not referenced to as an insertion and becomes a duplication, the variants are given a narrative description rather than an annotation.

The read data sets were created using [MakeSVgenome](https://github.com/msjimc/MakeSVGenome) with reads 10 kb long created each 1kb, with the orientation set alternate between successive reads. Where sequence data was moved from one chromosome to another, reads from the source chromosome were typically added to the alignment. Each of the files below, describing the analysis was created using a script and so, on occasions the language may be awkward.
