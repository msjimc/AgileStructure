# Chr7 ring chromosme

### Analysis of the genome in which: 

The region **chr7 10,000,000 to chr7 60,000,000** is insert after **chr7 60,000,001** with sequences **chr7 1 to 10,000,000** and **chr7 149,000,000 to 159,342,972** deleted

### Primary region spanning: chr7 10,000,000 

For this analysis the split reads at chr7 10,000,000 were selected and analysed using the ___Variant determination___ > ___Use soft clip data___ > ___Ring___ menu option.<hr />
